This repo is the source code for [HODL They Said...](https://holdtheysaid.club) - a small web app
displaying the losses in cryptocurrencies from their all time high values.

I've built it as a part of learning React front-end development.

It uses:
  - `create-react-app`
  - `Material UI` framework (with CSS-in-JS styling)
  - React Hooks
  - `axios` for fetching data from a couple of cryptocurrency APIs:
    1. `CoinPaprika` for retrieving the list of top 100 cryptocurrencies
    2. `Messari` for retrieving the all time high and current prices of the chosen cryptocurrency

The app is deployed on `Netlify`.
